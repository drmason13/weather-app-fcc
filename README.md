# [Weather App](http://weather-fcc-drmason13.surge.sh)

### Why was I made?

As part of the [free code camp curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.com). Building this app was good practice at making ajax calls to an external api and processing the results.

I made a previous attempt that experimented with building SVG graphics piece-by-piece to show the weather but it was slow and poorly supported by browsers.

### What do I do?

If you let me find your location, I will look up the weather in your location.

Then I show you the weather. Simple.

I also adjust my background to the time of day (including spectacular sunrise/sunset gradients!)
